# Performance Considerations for Java 23 Migration

This document outlines the performance considerations when migrating the exchange-core project from Java 8 to Java 23.

## Performance Impact Areas

### 1. JIT Compiler Improvements

Java 23 includes significant improvements to the JIT compiler compared to Java 8:

- Enhanced C2 compiler optimizations
- Better inlining decisions
- Improved escape analysis
- More aggressive loop optimizations

**Expected Impact:** Positive. General performance improvements of 5-15% for CPU-bound operations without any code changes.

### 2. Garbage Collection

Java 23 offers several modern garbage collectors:

- G1GC (default) - improved since Java 8
- ZGC - low-latency collector with sub-millisecond pauses
- Shenandoah - low-pause collector
- Parallel GC - throughput-focused collector

**Expected Impact:** Positive. Lower GC pauses and better throughput, especially important for the exchange-core's low-latency requirements.

**Recommendation:** Experiment with ZGC for lowest latency:
```
-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational
```

### 3. Memory Management

Java 23's Foreign Memory API provides better control over off-heap memory:

- Direct memory allocation without ByteBuffer overhead
- Explicit memory management with Arena
- Better integration with native code

**Expected Impact:** Positive for memory-intensive operations. Potential for reduced memory footprint and improved cache locality.

### 4. Virtual Threads

Virtual threads can improve throughput for I/O-bound operations:

- Reduced thread management overhead
- Better scalability for large numbers of concurrent operations
- Improved resource utilization

**Expected Impact:** Neutral to positive for the core matching engine (which is CPU-bound), but significantly positive for peripheral services like API handlers, reporting, and journaling.

### 5. Pattern Matching and Records

Modern Java features like pattern matching and records:

- Compiled to efficient bytecode
- May enable additional compiler optimizations
- Reduce boilerplate code

**Expected Impact:** Neutral. These features primarily improve code readability with minimal performance impact.

## Potential Performance Regressions

### 1. Disruptor Integration

The LMAX Disruptor library is central to exchange-core's performance. The upgrade to Disruptor 4.0.0 may require adjustments:

- Different threading model assumptions
- Changed API semantics
- New configuration options

**Mitigation:** Thorough performance testing and tuning of Disruptor configuration.

### 2. JVM Startup Time

Java 23 may have longer startup times compared to Java 8:

- More classes to load
- More complex JIT compilation
- Additional runtime verifications

**Mitigation:** Use Application CDS (Class Data Sharing) to improve startup time:
```
# Create a CDS archive
java -XX:+UseAppCDS -XX:DumpLoadedClassList=classes.lst -jar exchange-core.jar
java -XX:+UseAppCDS -XX:SharedClassListFile=classes.lst -XX:SharedArchiveFile=exchange-core.jsa -jar exchange-core.jar

# Use the CDS archive
java -XX:+UseAppCDS -XX:SharedArchiveFile=exchange-core.jsa -jar exchange-core.jar
```

### 3. Memory Footprint

Java 23 may have a larger memory footprint:

- More loaded classes
- Additional runtime features
- Different object layout

**Mitigation:** Monitor memory usage and adjust heap settings accordingly.

## Performance Testing Strategy

### 1. Baseline Measurements

Before migration:
- Record latency percentiles (50th, 90th, 99th, 99.9th, 99.99th)
- Measure throughput under various loads
- Profile memory usage and GC behavior
- Measure CPU utilization

### 2. Comparative Testing

After migration:
- Run the same performance tests with identical configurations
- Compare latency distributions
- Compare throughput under the same conditions
- Analyze memory usage patterns
- Monitor GC behavior

### 3. Tuning Areas

Focus tuning efforts on:

- GC configuration
- Thread pool sizes and configurations
- Memory allocation patterns
- JIT compiler flags

### 4. JVM Flags to Consider

```
# Low latency focus
-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational -XX:ConcGCThreads=2 -XX:ZCollectionInterval=5000

# Throughput focus
-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=4m

# Compiler optimizations
-XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat
```

## Monitoring Recommendations

- Use JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) for continuous monitoring
- Set up JMX monitoring for runtime metrics
- Implement custom metrics for business-specific performance indicators
- Consider async-profiler for low-overhead profiling

## Conclusion

The migration to Java 23 is expected to provide overall performance benefits, particularly in the areas of garbage collection, JIT optimization, and concurrent processing. However, careful testing and tuning will be required to ensure that the exchange-core's strict latency requirements continue to be met.
