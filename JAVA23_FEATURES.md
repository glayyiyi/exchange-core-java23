# Java 23 Features for Exchange-Core

This document outlines the Java 23 features that can be leveraged to improve the exchange-core project.

## Key Java 23 Features to Utilize

### 1. Virtual Threads

Virtual threads (Project Loom) can significantly improve the scalability of the exchange-core by allowing more efficient use of system resources. Virtual threads are lightweight and can be created in large numbers without significant overhead.

**Implementation Areas:**
- Replace thread pools with virtual threads for handling user connections
- Use virtual threads for background tasks like journaling and snapshots
- Implement virtual thread executors for non-latency-critical operations

```java
// Before
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);

// After
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
```

### 2. Pattern Matching for Switch

Pattern matching for switch expressions can make the code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with different order types and message handling.

```java
// Before
if (order instanceof GtcOrder) {
    GtcOrder gtcOrder = (GtcOrder) order;
    // process GTC order
} else if (order instanceof IocOrder) {
    IocOrder iocOrder = (IocOrder) order;
    // process IOC order
} else if (order instanceof FokOrder) {
    FokOrder fokOrder = (FokOrder) order;
    // process FOK order
}

// After
switch (order) {
    case GtcOrder gtcOrder -> processGtcOrder(gtcOrder);
    case IocOrder iocOrder -> processIocOrder(iocOrder);
    case FokOrder fokOrder -> processFokOrder(fokOrder);
    default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown order type");
}
```

### 3. Records

Records can be used for immutable data structures like order events, trade events, and configuration objects.

```java
// Before
public class TradeEvent {
    private final long timestamp;
    private final long price;
    private final long size;
    
    public TradeEvent(long timestamp, long price, long size) {
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
        this.price = price;
        this.size = size;
    }
    
    // getters, equals, hashCode, toString
}

// After
public record TradeEvent(long timestamp, long price, long size) {}
```

### 4. Sealed Classes

Sealed classes can be used to define a closed hierarchy of order types, ensuring type safety and enabling exhaustive pattern matching.

```java
public sealed abstract class Order permits GtcOrder, IocOrder, FokOrder {
    // common order properties and methods
}

public final class GtcOrder extends Order {
    // GTC specific implementation
}

public final class IocOrder extends Order {
    // IOC specific implementation
}

public final class FokOrder extends Order {
    // FOK specific implementation
}
```

### 5. Text Blocks

Text blocks can improve readability for SQL queries, configuration templates, and error messages.

```java
// Before
String query = "SELECT * " +
               "FROM orders " +
               "WHERE symbol = ? " +
               "AND price > ? " +
               "ORDER BY price DESC";

// After
String query = """
               SELECT *
               FROM orders
               WHERE symbol = ?
               AND price > ?
               ORDER BY price DESC
               """;
```

### 6. Enhanced NullPointerExceptions

Java's enhanced NPE messages provide more precise information about which part of an expression was null, making debugging easier.

### 7. Foreign Function & Memory API (Preview)

For performance-critical sections, the Foreign Function & Memory API can be used to interact with native code and manage off-heap memory more efficiently.

```java
// Example of using Foreign Memory API for direct memory access
try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    MemorySegment segment = arena.allocate(1024);
    // Use segment for high-performance memory operations
}
```

### 8. Structured Concurrency (Preview)

Structured concurrency can help manage the lifecycle of concurrent tasks, ensuring proper cleanup and error handling.

```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<OrderBook> orderBookFuture = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrderBook(symbol));
    Future<UserBalance> balanceFuture = scope.fork(() -> fetchUserBalance(userId));
    
    scope.join();
    scope.throwIfFailed();
    
    OrderBook orderBook = orderBookFuture.resultNow();
    UserBalance balance = balanceFuture.resultNow();
    
    // Process order with both order book and balance information
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Virtual threads may introduce slight overhead for very short-lived tasks
- Pattern matching and records have negligible performance impact
- Foreign Memory API can significantly improve performance for memory-intensive operations
- Structured concurrency may have a small overhead but improves code safety

## Migration Strategy

1. Start with non-critical components
2. Update one feature at a time
3. Run performance tests after each significant change
4. Focus on high-impact areas first (memory management, concurrency)
