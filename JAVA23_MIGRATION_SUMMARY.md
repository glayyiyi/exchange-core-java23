# Java 23 Migration Summary for Exchange-Core

## Migration Challenges

During our attempt to migrate the exchange-core project from Java 8 to Java 23, we encountered several challenges:

1. **Dependency Compatibility Issues**:
   - OpenHFT libraries (affinity, chronicle-wire) had version compatibility issues
   - We needed to find the correct versions that work with Java 23

2. **Lombok Integration Issues**:
   - The Lombok Maven plugin had compatibility issues with Java 23
   - We removed the Lombok Maven plugin from the build process to avoid these issues

3. **Builder Pattern Compatibility**:
   - Lombok's `@Builder` annotation generated code that wasn't compatible with our refactored classes
   - This caused compilation errors with classes like `ExchangeConfigurationBuilder`

## Successful Changes

Despite these challenges, we were able to make several important updates:

1. **Updated Maven Configuration**:
   - Set Java version to 23
   - Added support for preview features
   - Updated Maven plugins to latest versions

2. **Updated Dependencies**:
   - LMAX Disruptor: 3.4.2 → 4.0.0
   - JNA: 5.11.0 → 5.14.0
   - SLF4J: 1.7.36 → 2.0.12
   - Lombok: 1.18.24 → 1.18.32
   - Agrona: 1.15.1 → 1.20.0
   - Eclipse Collections: 11.0.0 → 11.1.0
   - Testing libraries (JUnit, Mockito, etc.)

3. **Refactored Core Classes**:
   - `OrderCommand.java`: Cleaned up code and improved readability
   - `ExchangeCore.java`: Added structured concurrency with `StructuredTaskScope`
   - `MatcherTradeEvent.java`: Used pattern matching and text blocks
   - `SingleUserReportQuery.java`: Converted to a record

## Next Steps

To complete the migration, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Incremental Approach**:
   - Start with a smaller scope, focusing on core functionality without Lombok
   - Gradually refactor classes to use Java 23 features
   - Test thoroughly after each change

2. **Lombok Alternatives**:
   - Consider using Java 23 records instead of Lombok for simple data classes
   - Use standard Java code for builder patterns instead of Lombok's `@Builder`

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Run performance tests to compare Java 8 vs Java 23 implementations
   - Focus on optimizing critical paths for the matching engine

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect Java 23 requirements
   - Document any API changes or behavior differences

## Conclusion

The migration to Java 23 offers significant potential benefits for the exchange-core project, including improved performance, better concurrency with virtual threads, and more expressive code with modern Java features. However, the migration process requires careful planning and incremental changes to ensure compatibility with existing code and dependencies.

The provided refactored classes demonstrate how Java 23 features can be leveraged to improve code quality and potentially performance. With further work, the entire codebase can be successfully migrated to take full advantage of Java 23's capabilities.
